## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to structure a simple component using semantic HTML and style it effectively with CSS. Here's an example of the CSS I used for centering the component:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my CSS skills, particularly with responsive design and advanced layout techniques like CSS Grid.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand how to use Flexbox for layout.
- [MDN Web Docs - HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - A great reference for semantic HTML.
